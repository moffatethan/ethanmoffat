It has been quite a bit of time since I've written. I wanted to try and push myself more to write updates more frequently on what I've been doing!

Truthfully, I've been pretty busy with <a href="https://purposemed.com/">work</a> and with that haven't really been devoting too much time to coding to avoid uber burnout. But I'm chugging along!

### Laravel

I've been learning Laravel more recently and InertiaJS to leverage VueJS on the front-end. What a blast this has been to really dive into somthing simple and really inviting to build with.

### Rentijoy

So, for months I was building REPRO which was a pretty big project for me to take on. While I'm confident I could pull this project off by myself and get something out, I'm trying to balance myself and follow my gut. I don't think the market needs this product right now, but maybe in the future!

I'm still gravitating towards Real Estate and want to make an impact in that industry. I've been eyeing rentals more recently.

Rentijoy is my next project I'm working towards built on Laravel using Jetstream which gives an amazing start template for free which gives you:

<ul>
  <li>Accounts</li>
  <li>Teams</li>
  <li>Dashboard</li>
  <li>Auth Pages</li>
  <li>Page Layout</li>
  <li>InertiaJS</li>
  <li>Multi-Factor Authentication</li>
</ul>

Pretty amazing for a free starter template to get your product up and running!

So, Rentijoy is going to be a rental marketplace and landlord management service. Rather than just providing the landlord product, I also want to try and capture some of the tenant side and make a solution where tenants can find their next home, pay rent on the app, talk to their landlord, sign leases, the whole shebang!

### Ambitious project

So, to call out the elephant in the room. Yes, Rentijoy is a big project. And I'm working through phases for it, maybe I don't launch the big listing site. Maybe I just focus on the tenant to landlord experience once that lead converts.

Maybe I focus on just landlords but generate simple landing pages for them for their properties and intake leads to them (arguably close to what the listing site is doing!)

I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to do. What I do know is I'm going to venture more into this business and give it a shot and see how far it'll take me.

Embracing failure is a skill I'm very proud to have, while I certainly don't set fourth to fail at anything. I definitely can recognize when it's time to kill an idea and move on, I'll be sure to write more about it overtime.
