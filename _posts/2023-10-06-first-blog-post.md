Not the best writing I'll have but this is my space on the internet. My name is Ethan and I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur, I love to code and build apps that solve problems. I currently live in Canada in a small city called Kamloops.

I do enjoy writing, but I'm very bad at keeping consistent with it. Hoping to leverage this little blog to share my knowledge and updates on my entrepreneurial journey. I want to build in public and I think this is a great way to start.

Hope you find it useful and if you have any questions, email me at ethan@moffatcore.ca
